As a part of a study project, realization of the structure of a blog.

## Technolgies
* PHP v7.4.1

## Server configuration
* Beforehand, make sure you have configured a virtual host.
* In my case I used MAMP
* Host : localhost using MAMP


## Development in PHP

## Database
* In this folder, add the blogphp.php file respecting the following format:
* define('DB_NAME', 'blogphp');
* define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
* define('DB_USER', 'root');
* define('DB_PWD', 'root');

* SQL Injection
To obtain a structure similar to my project at the database level, I also attach in the config folder a blogphp.sql file which will take care of building the database for you.
* Creating a "blogphp" database using MySQL : import blogphp.sql
